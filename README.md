# Pycasso
Deep learning server for generating art.


# Getting Started 
Pycasso has a number of image samples that can be used to test the art generation server locally. 
To get started, do the following:
1. Install dependencies
2. Run Pycasso.py
3. Run Integration.py in Test/Manual

## Samples
Integration.py will take some sample images already helpfully included in the folder and run Neural_Transfer on them. 
If you wish to replace your own images, simply add images to the Data folder and change out the queue_job call with your own images.
